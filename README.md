## United States Water Levels

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gathers information on numerous stations across the United States to monitor tides and currents. The data is collected and recorded through sensors placed on each of the stations. Throughout the United States, sensors are recording water level (WLLW), air temperature, water temperature, barometric pressure, winds, relative humidity, and visibility.

For this project, we are specifically looking at the recorded water level for 6 different stations in different regions and states throughout the United States: The Battery, NY; Virginia Key, Biscayne Bay, FL; Galveston Pier 21, TX; Monterey, CA; Prudhoe Bay, AK; and Honolulu, HI.
