It is a very fragile, essential ecosystem that provides a lot of biodiversity. To create a sustainable future, water levels need to be tracked and recorded to ensure that the bodies of water at the optimal height for sailors and aquatic animals. Every time a fisherman or sailor comes into a port, it is important for them to know the depth of the water and if their boat can fit in the shallowest parts of a canal. Sailing ships today are much larger than the old sailing ships (US Department of Commerce &amp; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2013). This knowledge is also critical because the increased marine traffic leaves no room for error and each vessel must maneuver correctly. The Earth is almost two-thirds water. Of that water, lakes contain 77% of the liquid surface fresh water (Molinos, Viana, Brennan, Donohue, 2015). As water levels change in the lakes, it affects the entire ecosystem around it. Extremely high or extremely low water levels are particularly bad by altering patterns of sediment deposition and inducing shifts in their trophic state (Molinos et al., 2015). In addition, the extremely high water levels cause shoreline damage and extremely low water levels generate water quality issues (Molinos et al., 2015). Although these extreme shifts in the water levels are detrimental on the ecosystem, the slight fluctuations in water levels are healthy since they balance the water nutrients and regulate the lakes. For our project, we will be specifically looking at the recorded water levels for 6 different stations in different regions and states throughout the United States; the stations we will be analyzing are The Battery, NY; Virginia Key, Biscayne Bay, FL; Galveston Pier 21, TX; Monterey, CA; Prudhoe Bay, AK; and Honolulu, HI. We want to compare the water level changes in different parts of the United States to see if any specific area is getting impacted more than other regions. Additionally, we want to look at each station individually to see the potential trends and seasonality in water level readings over the course of 20+ years.

Specifically, we are interested in how the water level changes over time in those locations as well as how the water levels and changes in water levels compare between locations. This is important because with this information about the different water level communities can gauge their risk of flooding and better plan for the changing sea levels. In fact many coastal communities are already seeing the effects of the changing sea levels, with more extreme water levels during storms and more frequent tidal flooding. In particular, the states we chose to focus on were The Battery, NY; Virginia Key, Biscayne Bay, FL; Galveston Pier 21, TX; Monterey, CA; Prudhoe Bay, AK; and Honolulu, HI. We chose a location in New York, as we are currently living here and thus, the changing water levels here will have an impact on us. We also chose locations in Florida, California and New York because they are among the top ten states with the highest water area. Similarly, we chose Texas because it is facing a water shortage. We also chose Arkansas because oftentimes have to deal with drought and in fact, currently, western Arkansas is now dealing with drought. We chose Hawaii as rising sea levels is a major problem for the island as it will cause chronic flooding for their major roads, cultural sites and make much of their land unusable. 2.2 Data availability During the process of identifying data sources, we wanted to ensure that the data was not aggregated, cleaning the data is manageable, and would be able to answer any business questions through visualizations. Initially, we were highly interested in an Alzheimers data set that appeared to be able to answer questions similar to how does race affect the frequency Alzheimers patients?, does gender affect Alzheimers?, and are there specific regions in the country that have a higher number of cases of Alzheimers?. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the data set structure was highly aggregated and the structure is very difficult to work with. The data was organized by each row corresponding to multiple stratifications. For example, one row corresponded to a specific question and the mean number of days for individuals that are Hispanic, female, and 50-64 years old. Overall, we determined the Alzheimers data set to be fairly complex and would not be reasonable to structure it in a tidy way, given the current structure and aggregations made. Therefore, we decided to change direction for our project and do a deeper dive into the current data structure and ensure its usability. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gathers information on numerous stations across the United States to monitor tides and currents. The data is collected and recorded through sensors placed on each of the stations. Throughout the United States, sensors are recording water level (WLLW), air temperature, water temperature, barometric pressure, winds, relative humidity, and visibility. For our project, we will be specifically looking at the recorded water level for 6 different stations in different regions and states throughout the United States; the stations we will be analyzing are The Battery, NY; Virginia Key, Biscayne Bay, FL; Galveston Pier 21, TX; Monterey, CA; Prudhoe Bay, AK; and Honolulu, HI. For each station, data for the water level is collected in 6-minute intervals. The page the data is on has the option to export it to a CSV file, and can be exported with specified data ranges and time intervals, which we plan to utilize. The current format of the data will be exported by the monthly generalizations of the data, in which case the data shows the month, the highest tide per month, the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW), the Mean High Water (MHW), the Mean Sea Level (MSL), the Mean Tide Level (MTL), the Mean Low Water (MLW), the Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), and the lowest tide. As each station is recorded separately, we will need to select the same parameters, time intervals, and data ranges for each station in separate CSV files, then merge all 6 station data sets into a single data set with an additional column to indicate the station location.

The data is collected and recorded through sensors placed on each of the stations. We will be specifically looking at the recorded water levels for 6 different stations in different regions and states throughout the United States; the stations we will be analyzing are The Battery, NY; Virginia Key, Biscayne Bay, FL; Galveston Pier 21, TX; Monterey, CA; Prudhoe Bay, AK; and Honolulu, HI. We collected water levels for each station from January 2020 - November 2022 on a monthly basis; it is important to note that some stations have data through part of December, which will be removed in the data transformation phase. These collections included all of the possible datums (the base elevation that was used for collection purposes), recorded in feet, but we will specifically be looking at the Mean Tide Level (MTL). Since the data is collected monthly, the time is always 00:00 GMT. By collecting the data on a monthly basis, we will be able to get the best overall long-term view of the data, 22 years.This will also ensure that the data is manageable and not overwhelming, while still being able to view long term trends and seasonality. Currently, the data has character, number, and integer fields; the only field that will need to be transformed is the date field. Additionally, majority of the states have 274 or 275 records depending on if they have December included, which will be transformed to only view data from November and prior. The only state that has less than 274 records is Alaska, which will be explored further in the missing patterns sections. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Overall, the data set was fairly clean and already in a usable state. However, each station had to be downloaded from the NOAA website individually, so we had to bind all of the data sets together to create one manageable data frame. Prior to binding the data frames, we created a new column for the State. Once bound together, the only field that needed to be transformed into the correct data type was the date field; we needed to convert from character to YYYY-MM-DD data format. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1642 obs. of 12 variables: ## $ state : chr &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AK&quot; ... ## $ Date : chr &quot;2000/01/01&quot; &quot;2000/02/01&quot; &quot;2000/03/01&quot; &quot;2000/04/01&quot; ... ## $ Time..GMT. : chr &quot;00:00&quot; &quot;00:00&quot; &quot;00:00&quot; &quot;00:00&quot; ... ## $ Highest : num 1.417 1.358 0.889 0.702 1.027 ... ## $ MHHW..ft. : num 0.715 0.771 0.2 0.157 0.623 ... ## $ MHW..ft. : num 0.6 0.689 0.105 0.069 0.515 ... ## $ MSL..ft. : num 0.377 0.449 -0.112 -0.154 0.299 0.771 0.83 0.719 0.883 0.725 ... ## $ MTL..ft. : num 0.367 0.451 -0.13 -0.156 0.295 0.771 0.817 0.643 0.876 0.714 ... ## $ MLW..ft. : num 0.135 0.213 -0.364 -0.381 0.075 0.548 0.561 0.344 0.6 0.443 ... ## $ MLLW..ft. : num 0.059 0.154 -0.42 -0.43 0.01 0.472 0.463 0.203 0.505 0.374 ... ## $ Lowest..ft.: num -0.741 -0.276 -1.299 -0.945 -0.456 ... ## $ Inf. : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... 3.3 Missing value analysis ## Lowest..ft.

Inf. ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 Based on above charts, we can see that there are only two variables with missing data points - Lowest Tide and Highest Tide. Since there are many other datums that we can use for the analysis and to view trends, seasonality, and make comparisons. Therefore, we will choose to omit these two fields from our analysis and use the other datums. 3.3.1 Alaska Missing Values Since Alaska was the only state that did not have 274 observations, it was missing 3 values, so we wanted to take a deeper look into what year and months did not have a recorded observations. Based on the first chart, we can see that there are missing values in 2013 and 2016; we are not concerned with seeing only 11 values in 2022 because we do not have that record yet. To dig into which exact months are missing, we broke the data down further into just 2013 and just 2016. When we did this, we could see that we are missing August 2013, September 2013, and June 2016.
